Create an image gallery

Reflection

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
I believe I achieved all regular requirements, as my page is responsive to mobile screen sizes, having also used media querires to change the size of my thumbnails between mobile and desktop. All my images have alts and I have used event handlers to allow for image switching using the thumbnails.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I did not achieve any of the reacher goals, perhaps if I had left more time, I would have been able to attempt them

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Optional
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
Feedback on general layout and code effieciency. I would like some help with the thumbnail container button, the code has been put in comments on JavaScript, it came out with an error I could not solve.

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
What went really well and what could have gone better?
